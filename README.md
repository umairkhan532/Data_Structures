# Data Structure Tutorial : Binary Tree



## I. OVERVIEW

Binary Tree is defined as a Tree data structure with at most 2 children. Since each element in a
binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child (1). An
implementation of a binary search tree is useful when elements can be compared less than /
greater than each other. For our example, we’ll use alphabetical order as our criteria for
whether an element is greater than or less than another element (eg. “alan” < “bob” < “dave” <
“john” < “kyle” < “leonard” < “zack”). (2)
